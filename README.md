## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Python Workshop!

In this workshop, we will instrument a Python application. Note this workshop
is meant to come after the Go workshop. The application and workshop steps can
be found in `/app`. The answer to this workshop can be found in
`app_instrumented`. Have suggestions on how to improve this lab? PRs welcomed!
